# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R21 (Database Restoration, Catalog Sync, and Full Workspace Build - Alpha.198)

## Summary

In this session, we executed a complete data recovery and workspace compilation cycle:

1. **Database Restoration**:
   - Restored `tormentnexus.db` (60.6 MB) from the `bobbybookmarks` backup archive, returning the workspace to its rich context state.
   - Executed `import_bobbybookmarks.py` to copy all bookmarks, atlas entries, embeddings, clusters, debates, nebula maps, and catalog entries successfully.
2. **Catalog Synchronization**:
   - Synchronized the active `assimilation_state.db` database with the catalog definitions by running `sync_catalog_to_assimilation.py` (23,181 total rows).
3. **Full Workspace Build**:
   - Clean-built the entire Node.js/Turbopack workspaces (including browser extensions) using `pnpm build`.
   - Verified that the Go sidecar and Wails GUI binary compile cleanly (`go build ./cmd/...`).

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-06-30 R20 (Completed OS Deep Link Scheme, SSO/RBAC Configurator, Catalog Sync, and Predictive Tool Classifier - Alpha.197)

## Summary

In this session, we successfully completed all planned roadmap features:

1. **OS Deep Link Scheme (`tormentnexus://`)**:
   - Added user-level protocol registry bindings under `HKCU\Software\Classes\tormentnexus` in `protocol_registry.go`.
   - Registered the `register-protocol` CLI command in `main.go` to handle OS-level deep links without requiring administrator elevation.
2. **SSO/RBAC Configurator UI**:
   - Added POST handler routes `/api/enterprise/sso/update` and `/api/enterprise/roles/update` in `missing_handlers.go` and registered them in `server.go`.
   - Rewrote the `/dashboard/enterprise` page in `page.tsx` with dynamic SSO settings forms and interactive role configurators.
3. **Smithery & Glama Catalog Sync Ingestion**:
   - Added a **Sync Directory** button to the Tool Catalog page header in `view.tsx` executing manual catalog pulls via `/api/links-backlog/sync`.
4. **Predictive Conversational Tool Injection**:
   - Created `predictive_injector.go` querying the local FreeLLM proxy on port `4000` to select top relevant tools based on user objectives.
   - Integrated predicted suggestions dynamically within the Go sidecar's `buildToolSuggestionSnapshotWithLimit` routine inside `tool_advertisements.go`.

## Key Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `go/internal/enterprise/security.go` | Added `UpdateSSO` and `UpdateRoles` with file-based persistence |
| `go/internal/httpapi/missing_handlers.go` | Added `handleEnterpriseUpdateSSO` and `handleEnterpriseUpdateRoles` |
| `go/internal/httpapi/server.go` | Registered the new update HTTP endpoints |
| `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/enterprise/page.tsx` | Built the interactive SSO settings form and RBAC role configurator |
| `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/mcp/catalog/view.tsx` | Added "Sync Directory" trigger button and handling |
| `go/internal/ai/predictive_injector.go` | Created classifier logic querying local FreeLLM proxy on port 4000 |
| `go/internal/httpapi/tool_advertisements.go` | Hooked up predicted tools to fallback suggestions |

## Verification
- Checked Go sidecar compilation (all binary targets compile cleanly).
- Monorepo package workspace compiled successfully via Turbopack (`pnpm run build:workspace`).

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-06-30 R17 (Swarm Compile Fix Pipeline, Wails Desktop GUI, 3 Dashboard Pages - Alpha.195)

## Summary

### Completed

1. **Swarm v7 Iterative Compile Fix (alpha.195)**: Replaced single-attempt `go build` rejection with a 3-round fix loop. When generated Go code fails, the ACTUAL compiler errors are formatted into a `make_compile_fix_prompt` and fed back to the LLM for automatic fixing. Files passing compilation are promoted to `tools/`; files failing all 3 rounds go to `_broken/`.
2. **Wails Desktop GUI**: Full build chain — `pnpm build:wails` builds Next.js standalone, `node copy-assets.mjs` extracts static assets to `frontend/dist/`, `go build ./cmd/tormentnexus-gui` produces `tormentnexus-gui.exe` (18MB).
3. **3 Dashboard Pages**: P2P Fleet-Wise Mesh, L3 Cold Archive, Enterprise Security.

### Key Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `swarm_v7.py` | Added `make_compile_fix_prompt()` + 3-round iterative compile loop |
| `copy-assets.mjs` | Extracts static HTML/CSS/JS from `.next-build/` |
| `next.config.js` | Kept as CommonJS (`.mjs` reverted) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | alpha.195 entry with all fixes |
| `VERSION` | 1.0.0-alpha.195 |

### Next Steps

- **Swarm pipeline**: Run with `SWARM_VERIFY_COMPILE=1` to test the iterative fix pipeline in production
- **Wails polish**: Need `next.config.js` restoration (reverted from `.mjs`), turbopack NFT warning still active
- **Track A (MCP Assimilation)**: The compile fix pipeline should dramatically increase yield rate

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-06-30 R16 (Executive Protocol R6 — Full Repo Sync, Port Cleanup, CHANGELOG, Dashboard Session Import - Alpha.194)

## Summary

Completed Executive Protocol R6 — comprehensive repository synchronization and multi-priority feature work:

### Step 1: Upstream Tracking & Submodule Sanitization

- **Fetched all remotes**: `origin` (MDMAtk/TormentNexus) and `origin-backup` (HyperNexusSoft/HyperNexus) — all tags pulled
- **Upstream sync**: No upstream parent remote configured (this is the canonical fork); backup fork `HyperNexusSoft/HyperNexus` inspected — contains 19 cosmetic rename commits (TormentNexus → HyperNexus) with no functional value to merge
- **Submodule update**: `apps/maestro` (robertpelloni/maestro) updated to commit `54c9ef7e58` — no nested submodules found

### Step 2: Dual-Direction Intelligent Merge Engine

- **Forward merge (features → main)**: Inspected 298 `task/` branches — ALL at identical stale commit `25a3a95ff` (`feat: add Go-native CLI with start/stop/status commands`), which is already an ancestor of `main`. No unique development progress in any task branch. **Zero work lost.**
- **Reverse merge (main → features)**: All 298 task branches are AI dev tool stubs created at the same point in history. None have active divergent work requiring back-merge.
- **Backup fork feature branch**: `origin-backup/feature/cloud-dashboard-mcp-sse-...` also contains only HyperNexus rename commits — skipped.

### Step 3: Workspace Cleanup, Documentation & Build Finalization

- **Script validation**: Updated `start.bat` — dashboard port 3000 → 7779, health check URLs corrected
- **Version governance**: Bumped `VERSION` → `1.0.0-alpha.194`, updated `CHANGELOG.md` with alpha.192-194 entries
- **Documentation**: Updated `HANDOFF.md` with full R6 summary

### Feature Work Completed (Parallel to Sync)

1. **FTS5 bulk rebuild** — row-by-row replaced with `INSERT FROM SELECT` + `COALESCE`, async startup goroutine (alpha.193)
2. **LimboPanel** — new L4 Limbo Vault component in Memory Explorer with search + resurrection (alpha.193)
3. **Session Import dashboard page** — `/dashboard/sessions/import` with scan/list/inspect/import UI (alpha.194)
4. **Dashboard port cleanup** — health/connectivity, MCP system, swarm SSE — all legacy 4100/3001 refs removed (alpha.193)

### Running Services (verified after build)

| Port | Service | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 7778 | Go sidecar | ✅ 59K memories, FTS indexed |
| 7779 | Dashboard | ✅ Production build clean |

### Next Steps for Successive Models

- **ChunkHound/Probe integration** — remaining native MCP search tools need Go handler wiring
- **P2P Memory Gossip** — 12/12 UDP tests pass, needs production service integration
- **Swarm Model Quality** — `swarm_v7.py` never runs `go build`; compilation verification is the single biggest quality improvement
- **L3 Cold Archive** — store layer is complete, consider adding a dedicated dashboard page for cold archive browsing
